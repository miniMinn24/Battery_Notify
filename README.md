# Battery_Notify
**A simple light-weight battery notifier script written for Hyprland WM users.**

Since Hyprland WM doesn't contains default notification for the battery is `charging, discharing, full` or `a warning message` for your battery's under low, you might be overwhelmed that you can't know your current battery status.

I wrote this in logic way ;)

# How it works
## battery_notify.sh
This scripts works just like other OSs' notifications. The only difference with other notifications scripts is that it <b>won't repeat</b> the status notification. Each time your battery is `charging`, `discharging`, or `fully charged`, the script will only notify for once.

## battery_warning.sh
This script is written to notify if the battery is too low that the computer might be shutted down in anytime.
